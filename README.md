# ME2-CRYPTO_SIDE_CHANNEL_ATTACK
Side-channel attacks on devices have gained increasing attention since their introduction in 2007. While traditional side-channel attacks, such as power analysis attacks and electromagnetic analysis attacks, required physical presence of the attacker as well as expensive equipment, an (unprivileged) application is all it takes to exploit the leaking information on modern mobile devices. Given the vast amount of sensitive information that are stored on smartphones, the ramifications of side-channel attacks affect both the security and privacy of users and their devices. The purpose of the documentation is to introduce side-channel attacks, as well as to assist in the decision making how to protect cryptographic modules against such attacks. The document is divided in to two parts: The First part presents side-channel attacks and provides introductory information about attacks. The second part presents known methods for protection against such attacks with a brief effectiveness assessment. This document is mainly intended for people who are considering the use of cryptographic modules and who need to compare several options with respect to their security.
